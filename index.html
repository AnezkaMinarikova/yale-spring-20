<h1>Objects in the mirror are closer than they appear</h1>

<i>Extension for internet browser that enables users to see the “invisible” content of the websites by printing it (ctrl+P).</i>
<br><br>


	<p>What kind of content is on the website but we dont see it (hidden content)?</p>

<ol>
		<li>source code</li></ol>

		<p>What does it contain and why it may be useful to see it/print it?</p><ol>

			<li>	meta Content/ meta tag: page description, keywords, author of the document, last modified, and viewport elements</li>

				 <li>comments and <a href="https://www.accuteach.com/5-crazy-hidden-messages-in-website-source-codes/"> ! </a></li>

					<li>	hidden or manipulated content: content moved outside of the viewable area beyond the borders of the page, hidden links</li>

						<li> img alt attribute: alternate text for an image, if the image cannot be displayed</li>

								<li>style (how many colors, fonts)</li>

              <li>visibility:hidden, display:none</li>

									<li>hover selector is used to select elements when you mouse over them</li>

										<li>	mouse enter and mouse:  leave  mouse moves between elements</li></ol>

											<p>How will the extension work and how it will be designed?</p>
                      <ol><li>The extension will be written with a content script that runs in the context of the page and may modify that website - in this case print certain elements of source code.

<li>Source code is in 99% of cases available for everyone to see, but it is commonly not understood by people without coding knowledge.</li> Source code is machine parsable.<li> This extension should be like a reader that displays the hiddent parts of the source code in a legible and engaging way.</li><ol>
